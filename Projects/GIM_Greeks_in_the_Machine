# GIM ‚Äì Greeks in the Machine  
*An Exploratory Framework for Options Sentiment, Forecasting, and Market Microstructure*

---

## Overview

Greeks in the Machine (GIM) is an applied research initiative that explores the dynamics of options markets using a combination of sentiment analysis, time-series forecasting, and custom Python/R tooling. It serves as both a testing ground for development and a portfolio of exploratory methods applied to real market data.

This project reflects my growth in:
- Translating complex financial theory into applied code
- Navigating multi-modal datasets (options chains, FRED time series, time and sales logs)
- Building modular, extensible tools for data-driven decision support

## Structure

GIM is divided into three functional components:

### 1. **Monte Carlo Simulations**
  - Developed as part of my early progression in Python and R
  - Models outcome distributions under variable volatility and strike conditions
  - Used to train intuition around derivatives behavior and path dependency
