# Mnemosyne  
*An Agentic Framework for Integrated Research and Knowledge Augmentation*

---

## Overview

Mnemosyne is an evolving system designed to connect structured personal notetaking with AI-driven insight retrieval. Built on the principles of agentic architecture, it establishes a bridge between **human-curated notes** and **language model-based analysis**, enabling more dynamic, recursive, and context-aware research workflows.

The framework uses Obsidian for local, markdown-based note capture, and leverages API-based interactions with GPT to enrich, retrieve, and synthesize information on demand.

## Core Objectives

- **Knowledge Structuring**: Maintain a modular, linked markdown vault as a primary knowledge repository.
- **API-Driven Querying**: Use GPT APIs to interpret and extend the vault's contents via natural language queries.
- **Memory Augmentation**: Support long-term idea development, linking, and cross-domain synthesis with minimal cognitive overhead.

## Architecture

### ⚙️ System Components

- **Obsidian Vault**  
  - Markdown-based knowledge graph
  - Daily notes, project pages, and evergreen concepts
  - Bi-directional linking and graph visualization

- **GPT Integration Layer**
  - Python scripts or web actions calling OpenAI APIs
  - Embedding and retrieval based on similarity search or semantic tags
  - Use cases include summarization, memory recall, comparative analysis, and transformation of raw notes into formal outputs

- **Data Flow**
