# Portfolio | Telos-in-the-Void

Welcome to my professional portfolio—a curated collection of technical and conceptual work in quantitative analysis, financial systems, and applied machine learning.

This repository serves as a centralized space to demonstrate key projects, research efforts, and frameworks developed throughout my career. It blends data science applications with systems-oriented thinking, and includes tools for finance, forecasting, and agentic knowledge integration.

## 🧭 Frameworks & Philosophy

### [`C = f(T × A)`](Philosophy/C_eq_f_Times_A.md)
A conceptual framework exploring the intersection of **Consciousness, Time, and Awareness**.  
This section outlines the underlying model and provides context for how systems design, decision theory, and time management align with my broader approach to problem-solving.

### [`Agentic Research Interface: Mnemosyne`](Projects/Mnemosyne/README.md)
A modular framework to connect structured notetaking in Obsidian with GPT-based API workflows.  
This project focuses on:
- Augmenting idea retrieval and synthesis through LLMs
- Creating bi-directional communication between local knowledge and external language models
- Establishing reproducible research and note management via automation

### [`Strategic Architecture: The Council`](Projects/WarCouncil/README.md)
A decision-making and planning framework using structured personas and role-based modeling.  
This initiative explores:
- Archetype-based design for planning, reflection, and internal dialogue
- Systems strategy modeling through defined perspectives (e.g., executive, scout, analyst, operations)
- Tooling to support creative and strategic alignment across complex projects
